The purpose of the mariaConnector() function in main.py is to first establish a connection to a mariaDB docker instance that is either locally or globally hosted,
utilizing default, or user-defined credentials. From here the mariaDB connection will ask the user if there is already a specific database on the server that
they would like the program to utilize, depedning on user query, the program can wipe the current database and format it properly for use, or create a new database in the server
with either the default database name 'bankSys' or a user-defined database name.
